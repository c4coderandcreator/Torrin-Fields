         <p class="para-about">Hello! Torrin Fields, a passionate UX designer with a keen eye for creating engaging and
            user-centric digital platforms. My design philosophy is deeply rooted in understanding and
            addressing the unique needs ot users. Through comprehensive research, including
            interviews and surveys, I've a knack for transforming user insights into innovative
            design solutions. <br> <br>
            One standout project in my portfolio is a pop culture apparel e-commerce platform.
            Recognizing the challenges many face in finding authentic pop culture-themed clothing,
            I crafted a platform that not only resonates with the aesthetics but also ensures a seamless
            shopping experience. Every design decision was driven by the goal to connect users with
            the pop culture icons they cherish, making their shopping journey both enjoyable and
            memorable,</p>

            <p class="sub-head">• Problem Statement</p>
           <p class="text">
            I wanted to make the Of movie nights as simple and quick as possible.
            VVe know that planning get-togethers can be a headache. Moreover, this problem is
            particularly challenging since everyone has different tastes in snacks, games and
            movies, which may also vary based on their mood.
            </p>
            <p class="border-side">We at Movie Night are dedicated to reinventing the process of
                preparing a movie-themed party. We recognize the difficulties in
                planning an event, from themed games and snacks to cocktails and
                trailers, and we work to make the procedure more efficient. We
                provide an all-in-one platform with everything you require for your
                event since we want to make party planning as simple as possible.
                Simply choose the theme direction, and we'll take care of the rest,
                making party planning easy and fun.
                </p>
            <p class="sub-head">• Solution</p>
            <p class="text">
                We ran 7 weeks of design sprints based on the design thinking methodology, which
                includes 5 stages: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. We eventually
                created a fully functional app with a movie quiz. Wth little A1 help, you can get
                movie recommendations based on your moodlpreferences in as little as 3
                minutes.</p>
            <p class="border-side">Users choose a movie theme on our platform, and we put together
                a customized party package. Our final product is a thorough event
                schedule that includes activities, refreshments, drinks, and movie
                trailers. We make complicated party planning easy and enjoyable
                with Movie Night.</p>

            <p class="sub-head">• Outcome</p>
            <p class="text">
                We've successfully created a responsive website that solves the major problem of
                "finding something to do for movie night". We got a lot of positive feedback about an
                idea and website. Moreover, we've improved the usability by 40% However, we can't
                tell exactly if the movie-themed snacks results will resonate with users, so it would be
                nice to revisit the project in the future and to test that out.
             </p>
             <p class="sub-head">• Takeaway</p>
             <p class="text">
                We've noticed that it's better to avoid different Ul implementations on the
                wireframes stage since users were distracted and cnntinued giving feedback more on
                the 100k and feel rather than usability issues Of the app.</p>
